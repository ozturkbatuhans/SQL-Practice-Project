# SQL-Practice-Project

This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts created as part of the *Database1* course. The files include classroom examples, exercises, and a main project script that demonstrates various SQL techniques.

##  Project Structure

### `Ozturk_Batuhan.sql`
Main project file containing:
- Table creation scripts
- Data insertion statements
- Queries using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
- Use of subqueries and aggregate functions

### `les.sql`
In-class examples file:
- Basic SQL commands (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)
- Simple schema definitions
- Used during theory sessions

### `les_oef.sql`
Lesson exercises file:
- Practice tasks given in class
- Designed to reinforce SQL concepts
- Includes basic to intermediate queries

### `SQLQuery1.sql`
Supplementary query file:
- Additional queries or tests
- May include draft or experimental statements

## How to Use

1. Open your preferred SQL environment (e.g., SQL Server Management Studio).
2. Run `les.sql` and `les_oef.sql` to review lesson content and exercises.
3. Execute `Ozturk_Batuhan.sql` to explore the main project and see applied SQL logic.
4. Optionally, inspect `SQLQuery1.sql` for extra practice or experimentation.
